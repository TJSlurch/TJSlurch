## [Starry Summit]

**Description:**
Starry Summit is a 2D platformer which is heavily inspired by 'Celeste'. The player can run, jump, dash, wall climb and wall jump! There are a range of different gameplay items throughout the level (springs, teleporters, moving platforms) and there are 10 optional collectibles for players who want to challenge themselves.

## [Neomnia]

**Description:**
Neomnia was my submission for the 2024 University of Bath GameJam! For the theme "Colour Changes Everything", I wanted to create a 2D platformer where the player can change colour to influence gameplay. Upon touching a coloured tile, the character changes slightly.
